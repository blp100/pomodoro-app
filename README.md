## Overview
I really appreciate the Pomodoro timer concept, and the appealing UI design is another reason why I chose this project. Additionally, I wanted to enhance my knowledge of CSS animation, making it the third reason take this challenge.

This is my second time use the Chakra UI, and I wanted to become more acquainted with framer-motion. That's why I took this challenge. And here we go.

### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts
- Store user settings

### Continued development
Upon finishing this challenge, I found that the greatest difficulty lied in the unclear project requirements and my personal preferences regarding the Pomodoro timer. However, I realized that this allowed me to bring my own creative ideas and make the challenge even more satisfying. It has sparked a desire in me to further improve and refine the Pomodoro concept in future endeavors.
